# Analog Peripheral Manager (APM) — Triangle Waveform Generation with FVR, ADC, DAC and APM Using the PIC18F56Q71 Microcontroller with MCC Melody

This code example highlights the capabilities of the Analog Peripheral Manager (APM) and its configuration in MPLAB® Code Configurator (MCC) Melody. The Fixed Voltage Reference (FVR) peripheral provides voltage references of 2.048V and 4.096V to the Analog-to-Digital (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC), respectively. The DAC peripheral is used to output a triangle waveform with variable amplitude controlled by the value measured by the ADC from a potentiometer. The APM is set as the auto-conversion trigger source for the ADC, and the Timer1 (TMR1) module’s overflow interrupt is used to alter the output of the DAC peripheral. The ADC peripheral’s conversion-complete interrupt is used to modify the amplitude of the triangle waveform. The APM periodically enables the FVR to set the voltage references, the ADC to perform a single conversion, and the DAC to output the triangle waveform.

  The configured APM period is 12s. The Start 1 event, which enables the FVR Buffer 1 and the analog part of the ADC peripheral, occurs 5s after the period counter started. The APM is set as the ADC Auto-conversion Trigger Source, therefore the ADCD Peripheral Start bit needs to be enabled for a conversion to be triggered. The Start 2 event, which enables the FVR Buffer 2, the DAC1 and the ADCD peripherals, occurs 1s after the Start 1 event.

## How to Use the Variable Voltage Supply on the Curiosity Nano Board

The VOFF pin connected to the Curiosity Nano board is pulled low on the Curiosity Nano Adapter. When VOFF is low, the variable voltage power suppy on the Curiosity Nano board is disabled, and 3.3V is supplied from the Curiosity Nano Adapter to the microcontroller.

The FVR peripheral's output cannot exceed V<sub>DD</sub>, so to obtain a fixed voltage reference of 4.096V some hardware changes must be made to the Curiosity Nano Adapter board.

<br><img src="images/Curiosity-Nano-Adapter-2.PNG" height="400">

To use the variable voltage power supply on the Curiosity Nano board, remove resistors R11 and R15 from the Curiosity Nano Adapter. For additional information on this subject refer to [Curiosity Nano Base for Click boards™ Hardware User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Curiosity-Nano-Base-for-Click-boards-User-Guide-50002839.pdf).

**Note:** The above changes are optional for this code example. If not performed, the FVR peripheral's output will be limited to V<sub>DD</sub>, which is 3.3V by default.
